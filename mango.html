            <h1>THE FRESH AND ORGANIC MANGOES</h1>
            <p> Mango is my favorite fruit. The reason I love mangoes so much is their lip-smacking flavor and crazy
            driving fragrance. In India there are over 100 mango varieties found.
            The size, color and flavor of all of them are different. I love the 'Hapus ' mangoes most of all of
            these varieties. They're luscious and sweet.</p>
